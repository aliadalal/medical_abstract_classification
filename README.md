# medical_abstract_classification
The business goal is to develop an application that can categorize a medical abstract into one of the five conditions. Each class represent current medical condition of a patient. These conditions are:  
These classes 
    1	neoplasms
	2	digestive system diseases
	3	nervous system diseases
	4	cardiovascular diseases
	5	general pathological conditions
To aid in the development of the application, dataset containing ~28k labelled abstracts is provided. 

Initial analysis shows that a text classification machine learning technique may be applied to develop an application, which when given an abstract will be capable of returning the most likely condition that the medical abstract is referring to in the text and hence the patient associated to the abstract is currently afflicted to.
